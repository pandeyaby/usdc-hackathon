Hi OpenAI Developer Relations team,

I wanted to share a skill we've built that might be valuable for the OpenAI Skills ecosystem:

**Autonomous Commerce Skill**
GitHub: https://github.com/pandeyaby/usdc-hackathon/tree/main/autonomous-commerce

**What makes it unique:**
This is the first (and currently only) agent skill with proven real-world commerce capability. Not a simulation or demo — actual purchases with delivery confirmation.

**Proof of capability:**
- Date: February 6, 2026
- Amount: $68.97 (2 Amazon orders, 8 items)
- Proof hash: 0x876d4ddfd420463a8361e302e3fb31621836012e6358da87a911e7e667dd0239
- Delivery: Confirmed February 9, 2026
- Evidence: Screenshots (PII redacted)

**Key features:**
- Complete OpenAI Skills format documentation (following your best practices blog post)
- Security guardrails (agent uses pre-saved payment/addresses only)
- Escrow integration (ClawPay on Base)
- Cryptographic proof generation
- Budget caps enforced
- Open source (MIT license)

**Use cases:**
- Autonomous shopping assistants
- Price-drop automation
- Inventory monitoring (buy when back in stock)
- Recurring purchase automation

We'd be happy to:
1. Submit a PR to coinbase/agentic-wallet-skills if appropriate
2. Share this with the OpenAI Skills community
3. Answer questions about the architecture or proof system

The skill is production-ready and has already executed successful real-world purchases.
