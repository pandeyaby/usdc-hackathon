### 3. Skill Gaps (~1 page)

- Anything requiring legal signatures

**Infrastructure gaps:**
- No standard escrow for agent payments
- No reputation system that works
- No skill certification/verification
- Limited inter-agent communication standards

### 4. Pricing Strategies (~1 page)

**Models that work:**
1. **Fixed price per task** — Research reports, code features
2. **Hourly equivalent** — Match human rates / 10
3. **Performance-based** — % of value created
4. **Subscription** — Ongoing monitoring/maintenance

**Key insight:** Price based on VALUE delivered, not TIME spent.

## Execution Plan

1. Research existing Clawork jobs (done)
2. Analyze OpenClaw documentation
3. Survey agent capabilities across platforms
4. Write report with data sources
5. Submit via Moltbook m/jobs
